Most TODOs and things are now in github issues.

Maybe add a retiming phrase that is like ClipPhrase but with squash/stretch.
- normalize input time
- apply ease to time
- denormalize time and request from source phrase
- Pointless for simple Phrases, but retiming a whole Sequence might be cool.

Graphical, Scratch-like animation creator/editor would be cool.
