Snapshot 0.5.0 (2009-04-11 Philip de Nier <philipn@users.sourceforge.net>)
==========================================================================

- differentiate between a general XML error and an unbound prefix error so that
common errors such as missing xlink namespace declarations are easily identified
- render engine API callback function can now be set to null if they are not 
implemented
- replaced path callbacks with a path data structure which makes it simpler and
allows text-on-path to be implemented in future releases
- simplified path data by removing redundant elements
- peeking ahead in parse tree to avoid redundant or unneccessary render 
callbacks
- added utility function to convert elliptical arc endpoint parameterization to 
center point parameterization
- merged render_image_buffer callback with render_image and added a function to
detect data: scheme URIs
- setting viewport x and y for patterns to 0, requiring client applications to
make the adjustment 'manually'
- added utility function to return a relative image URI relative to the document
- added utility function to return the list of image URIs for the document
- supporting UTF-8 characters when processing text data
- added end_transform and end_style callback functions to allow clients apps to
detect the end of the respective sections
- several code cleanups and restructuring

Bug fixes
---------


Snapshot 0.4.0 (2009-03-23 Philip de Nier <philipn@users.sourceforge.net>)
==========================================================================

libcroco library
- Creating an XML DOM tree for processing CSS before creating the SVG tree

application can use a utility function to read and decode the image
- Improved support for <text> and <tspan> elements
- Improved support for patterns
- Providing line number and element name information for better error reporting
- XML parsing is now namespace aware
- Added function to allow user applications to set the SVG base directory for 
resolving external references

Bug fixes
---------
- fix memory leaks associated with <text> and <tspan> handling
- fix ordering of colors causing color not to be found in Windows build
- fix various initializations and defaults
- cleaned up gradient processing
- removed bitfields in struct decls causing platform incompatibilities

Snapshot 0.1.4 (2005-06-15 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
- Add support to use expat rather than libxml2 for XML parsing.
  Use the "--with-expat" argument to configure or autogen.sh.
