/**
 @brief This class implements a DecisionTreeThresholdNode, which is a specific type of node used for a DecisionTree.
 
 @description The node creates a spilt for each node in a DecisionTree by finding the threshold and feature that minimizes
 the error on the training data at that node.  The threshold is found by iterating over the range of the training data and
 finding the threshold and feature index that results in the minimum error.
