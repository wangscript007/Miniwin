    only notifies Viaccess-Orca about the sections that are error-free and pass the Cyclic Redundancy 
    Codes (CRC) check, if available.

    @param [in] dwVaFilterHandle    The filter handle that the STB is provided with when 
                                    the filter is allocated. Refer to @ref nglAllocateSectionFilter for details.
    @param [in] uiBufferLength      This value gives the length in bytes of the buffer that 
                                    contains the filtered section.
    @param [in] pBuffer             The address of the section buffer. The first byte must be the 
                                    table identifier of the section. It may be freed when this

    @param [in] pUserData           Pointer to a STB driver user data which is set by the STB 
                                    manufacturer. The value pointed to by this parameter is not

    This function allocates a filter to a PID.

    @param [in] dmx_id                        The value of this parameter is between 0 and `uiNbAcs`-1. 
                                               The `uiNbAcs` value is the number of ACS required by the 
                                               STB at initialization stage. For information on 
                                               initialization, refer to @ref ctrlAPI.
                                               @n The `dwAcsId` parameter indicates the ACS (demux) 
                                               instance the filter is allocated to.
    @param [in] dwVaFilterHandle               The Viaccess-Orca ACS uses this value to identify a filter 
                                               instance. It corresponds on a one to one basis to the 
                                               `dwStbFilterHandle` value returned by this function. 
                                               The STB manufacturer must store and keep the 
                                               `dwVaFilterHandle` value whilst the filter is allocated. 
                                               The STB uses this value to notify the Viaccess-Orca ACS that a 
                                               section matches that given filter criteria.
    @param [in] wPid                           This value gives the PID of the demux channel to which the 
                                               filter is allocated. Viaccess-Orca may allocate several filters 
                                               with the same PID.
    @param [in] filterCallback                  This is a pointer of callback function. The STB calls this 
                                               function to notify  that a section matches the 
                                               filter criteria. The buffer that contains the section is 
                                               specified in the `pBuffer` parameter. The STB only notifies 
                                               Viaccess-Orca about the sections that are error-free and pass the 
                                               Cyclic Redundancy Codes (CRC) check, if available. Note also 
                                               that for a matching section the STB calls this notification 
                                               function according to the specified notification mode (the 
                                               @ref tDMX_NotificationMode parameter passed in the function 
                                               @ref DMX_SetSectionFilterParameters): only once or continuously.

    @retval dwStbFilterHandle                  It must be unique. This means that two filters can never have the 
                                               same handle value even if they belong to two different ACS instances.
