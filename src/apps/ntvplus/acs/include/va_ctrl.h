/**
    This function is used to set the SOID black-list required by the universe partitioning feature. Calling this
    function has a meaning only for the STB manufacturers that need to handle several simulcrypt operators, each
    of them offering its own universe. The STB manufacturer provides the SOID black-list each time users switch
    universe. This list is used by the ACS instance to discard all ECM channels of the next selected program(s), for
    which the SOID values match those in the list. 

    Note that it is up to the STB manufacturer to manage the association between universes and black-listed SOIDs.
    An ACS instance handles the SOID black-list obeying the following rules:
    - by default, there is no SOID black-list,
    - an SOID black-list set via the VA_CTRL_SetSoidBlackList function remains active until the ACS instance is closed,
    - the SOID black-list can be changed during the ACS instance life-time by calling the VA_CTRL_SetSoidBlackList function,
    - the SOID black-list can be reset (return to the initial default state, with no SOID black-list) by calling the
      VA_CTRL_SetSoidBlackList function with an empty SOID black-list (i.e. uiSoidCount set to 0 and
      pSoidBlackList set to NULL),
    - once the SOID black-list is set, the ACS instance will take it into account starting from the next PMT
      parsing. That means that typically the STB manufacturer should call VA_CTRL_SetSoidBlackList
      before calling VA_CTRL_SwitchOnProgram. If the ACS instance is already open the STB manufacturer
      should call first VA_CTRL_SwitchOffProgram, then VA_CTRL_SetSoidBlackList and finally VA_CTRL_SwitchOnProgram.

    Viaccess-Orca uses this function to retrieve the current network and program information.
    @param [in] dwAcsId The value of this argument lies between 0 and uiNbAcs-1,
                         with uiNbAcs the number of ACS required by the STB at initialization.
                         The dwAcsId parameter specifies the ACS instance of the program information to be retrieved.
    @param [in] pProgramInfo Pointer to the address of a tVA_CTRL_ProgramInformation structure.
                          Viaccess-Orca allocates and frees the memory, but the structure fields are filled by the STB manufacturer.
    
    @retval kVA_OK                 If the required information is available and was returned to Viaccess-Orca.
    @retval kVA_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE If the required information is not available yet.
                                   This return code can be used if the NIT table has not yet arrived for example.
    @retval kVA_ERROR              For any other reason.

    @b Comments
    @n The VA_CTRL_GetProgramInformation function must return kVA_OK and set the wNetworkId field of the
    @ref tVA_CTRL_ProgramInformation structure to 0x0 for an IP stream.

    @note The information of the NIT/SDT stream for NetworkId should be returned only when it is available. Otherwise, the
    return value is @ref kVA_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.
