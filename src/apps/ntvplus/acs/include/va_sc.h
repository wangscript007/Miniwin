 @{

 All of these functions are coded by the STB manufacturer.@n
 The functions are defined in:@n
 `va_sc.h`
*/

/**
 This function resets a given smartcard.
 @param [in] dwScSlot Indicates the slot number of the smartcard. This value ranges from 0 to uiNbSmartCard--1.
 @param [in] uiPPSNegotiationValue This parameter is set with the PPS (Protocol Parameter Selection) negotiation
                                   value requested by the ACS.
                             <br> If this value is 0, or if the interface byte TA1 of the smartcard (described in the ISO/IEC 7816-3 document) is absent,
                             the PPS negotiation must not take place.
                             <br> On the other hand, if the ATR (Answer To Reset) specifies that the card permits negotiation,
							 the VA_SC driver proceeds with a PPS negotiation to request a change in the communication speed.
                             <br> The 4 MSB of `uiPPSNegotiationValue` indicates the factor F and the 4 LSB specifies the factor D,
							 similarly to the interface byte TA1.
                             <br> The STB manufacturer must fine tune the negotiated Fn value as close as possible to F (Fn < = F),
							 taking into account the limitations of the smartcard given by the ATR.
							 Likewise, the value Dn must be as close as possible to D (Dn < = D).
                             <br> Note that according to the ISO/IEC 7816-3 tables, it is the referenced values and
							 not the references that must be tuned.
							 For example, if the negotiation value D is 0x6 and the smartcard handles 0x1 and 0x8,
							 the negotiated value should be 0x8 (as the referenced value for 0x6 is greater than the referenced
							 value for 0x8).
 @retval kVA_OK                If the request is accepted.

 @retval kVA_RESOURCE_BUSY     If the smartcard reader is already processing a reset command previously required by Viaccess-Orca.
 @retval kVA_INSERT_CARD_FIRST If no smartcard is present in the slot.

 @b Comments @n Once the reset process has been successfully carried out, the STB calls the Viaccess-Orca function @ref VA_SC_ResetDone.
      On the other hand, if an error occurs during the reset process, the STB calls @ref VA_SC_ResetFailed.
 @note The STB must call the @ref VA_SC_ResetFailed function when the PPS exchange between the driver and the smartcard fails.
